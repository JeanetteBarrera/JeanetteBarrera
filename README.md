## Hi there, I’m Jeane 👋

- 💻 I’m a programmer from Argentina, passionate about Data Science, with a special focus on statistics and machine learning.
- 🌱 I am continuously learning and, in my free time, I deepen my knowledge of AWS to optimize cloud projects.
- 🔬 My interest goes beyond just data analysis; I’m also focused on prediction, algorithm development, and creating models that help us interpret patterns, identify relationships, and extract valuable insights from large datasets.
- 🧬 I am passionate about bioinformatics, genetics, and the study of nature, fields where data analysis can have a significant impact on improving our understanding of biology, health, and the environment.
- 🌍 I believe data has the power to transform the world, and my goal is to decipher that information to better understand the world we live in and contribute to a better future.
